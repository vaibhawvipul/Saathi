          <p>It was used to assign writers(volunteers) to blind candidates who will require a writer in their examinations. It was programmed in Python 2.7 .</p>

<p>This code was written by Vipul Vaibhaw as a first year undergrad at Fergusson College, Pune.
Data entry is done from csv(Comma separated values) files and also stores in csv file.
The department wanted output in Excel file, so I used .csv file.
This code was conceived and written in three days. SQL was not used intentionally.</p>
